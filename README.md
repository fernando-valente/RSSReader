RSSReader
=========

RSSReader is a simple Mac application for reading RSS. This project was written by me in less than an hour 
just to pass the time. That will probably give you an idea of how simple it is. It might be useful to those who are still 
learning Objetive-C.

It's basically a window with a NSTextField, a NSButton and a NSSplitView containing a NSTableView and a WebView. 
The source code for this app is very useful if you want to see a working example of NSURLConnection and NSTableView
(which includes basic delegate and datasource methods). With less than 150 lines, this project is extremely easy to 
understand. :)
